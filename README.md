# Mnomer

Mnome is a metronom application written in Rust.
It is mainly an enhanced copy of [mnome](https://github.com/thfr/mnome), a C++ project of mine.
The main purpose is to experiment with and train myself in the Rust programming language.

# Usage

Following commands are implemented: `start`, `stop`, `bpm <number>` and `pattern <pattern>` with `<pattern>` adhering to `[!|+|\.]*`
